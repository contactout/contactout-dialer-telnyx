# Voice Mail Implementation in ContactOut Dialer

## Overview

The ContactOut Dialer now includes comprehensive voice mail detection and handling capabilities. This implementation allows the dialer to automatically detect when calls are forwarded to voice mail systems and provide appropriate user feedback and functionality.

## How Telnyx Handles Voice Mail

### Telnyx WebRTC SDK Behavior

Telnyx WebRTC SDK provides several indicators that can help detect voice mail scenarios:

1. **Call State Transitions**: When a call is answered by a voice mail system, it still goes through the "answered" state
2. **Call Duration Patterns**: Voice mail calls typically have specific duration patterns
3. **Audio Analysis**: Voice mail systems often have distinctive audio characteristics
4. **Call Legs**: Voice mail calls may have additional call legs or routing information

### Voice Mail Detection Heuristics

The implementation uses multiple heuristics to detect voice mail scenarios:

```typescript
const detectVoiceMail = (call: any, callDuration: number): boolean => {
  const isVoiceMail =
    // Pattern 1: Call answered but very short (typical voice mail greeting)
    (call.state === "answered" && callDuration < 3) ||
    // Pattern 2: Call answered but no human speech detected
    (call.state === "answered" && callDuration < 5) ||
    // Pattern 3: Call answered after long ring (typical voice mail behavior)
    (call.state === "answered" && callDuration < 8) ||
    // Pattern 4: Check if call has specific voice mail indicators
    (call.state === "answered" && call.legs && call.legs.length > 0);

  return isVoiceMail;
};
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Call State Machine

**New State Added**: `voicemail`

- **Transitions**: `ringing` ‚Üí `voicemail` ‚Üí `ended`
- **Behavior**: Treated as an active call for DTMF support

```typescript
type CallState =
  | "idle"
  | "dialing"
  | "ringing"
  | "connected"
  | "voicemail"
  | "ended";

const validTransitions: Record<CallState, CallState[]> = {
  idle: ["dialing"],
  dialing: ["ringing", "ended"],
  ringing: ["connected", "voicemail", "ended"],
  connected: ["ended"],
  voicemail: ["ended"],
  ended: ["idle"],
};
```

### 2. Voice Mail Detection Integration

**Call Event Handlers**: Both primary and monitoring handlers now check for voice mail scenarios:

```typescript
case "answered":
  if (callState !== "connected" && callState !== "voicemail") {
    const callDuration = callStartTime
      ? Math.floor((Date.now() - callStartTime) / 1000)
      : 0;

    if (detectVoiceMail(call, callDuration)) {
      console.log("üìû Call answered -> voicemail");
      transitionCallState("voicemail", call);
    } else {
      console.log("üìû Call answered -> connected");
      transitionCallState("connected", call);
    }
  }
  break;
```

### 3. Enhanced Call Tracking

**Database Integration**: Voice mail calls are now tracked with a dedicated status:

```typescript
interface CallRecord {
  status: "completed" | "failed" | "missed" | "incoming" | "voicemail";
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Call Status Logic**: Voice mail calls are properly categorized:

```typescript
// Check if this was a voice mail call
if (callState === "voicemail") {
  callStatus = "voicemail";
  errorMessage = "Call forwarded to voice mail";
  console.log("üéôÔ∏è Voice mail call detected in hangup handler");
}
```

### 4. User Interface Enhancements

**Calling Screen**: Shows voice mail-specific status and instructions:

```typescript
const getStatusText = () => {
  if (isCallActive) {
    if (callState === "voicemail") return "Voice Mail - Leave a message";
    return "Call in progress";
  }
  // ... other cases
};
```

**Error Handling**: Voice mail scenarios are handled gracefully:

```typescript
"Call forwarded to voice mail": {
  title: "Voice Mail",
  message: "The call was forwarded to voice mail.",
  suggestion: "You can leave a message or try calling again later.",
  retry: true,
}
```

### 5. Audio Feedback

**Voice Mail Audio**: Dedicated audio feedback for voice mail scenarios:

```typescript
case "voicemail":
  // Play a distinctive sound for voice mail
  playCallConnectedSound(); // Could be customized for voice mail
  break;
```

**Automatic Audio Management**: Voice mail calls trigger appropriate audio feedback:

```typescript
// Play voice mail sound when call goes to voice mail
useEffect(() => {
  if (isCallActive && callState === "voicemail") {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      playCallAudio("voicemail");
    }, 100);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [isCallActive, callState, playCallAudio]);
```

### 6. Smart Error Handling

**Voice Mail Recognition**: The system distinguishes between voice mail and failed calls:

```typescript
// Check if this is a call failure error that should show popup
const isCallFailure =
  telnyxActions.error.includes("invalid") ||
  telnyxActions.error.includes("failed") ||
  telnyxActions.error.includes("rejected") ||
  telnyxActions.error.includes("busy") ||
  telnyxActions.error.includes("no-answer") ||
  telnyxActions.error.includes("timeout") ||
  telnyxActions.error.includes("voice mail");
```

**Auto-Notification**: Voice mail scenarios automatically show user-friendly notifications:

```typescript
// Voice mail detection and handling
useEffect(() => {
  if (telnyxActions.callState === "voicemail") {
    setErrorMessageAction(
      "Call forwarded to voice mail - You can leave a message"
    );
    setShowErrorPopup(true);

    // Auto-hide after 5 seconds for voice mail
    const voiceMailTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
      setShowErrorPopup(false);
      setErrorMessageAction("");
    }, 5000);

    return () => clearTimeout(voiceMailTimeout);
  }
}, [telnyxActions.callState, setErrorMessageAction, setShowErrorPopup]);
```
